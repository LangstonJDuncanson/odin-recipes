    <h1>Almond Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies (Classic Chewy):</h1>
<p>These cookies are the epitome of keto cookie perfection – soft, chewy, and packed with rich chocolate chips. The secret ingredient? A combination of almond flour and coconut flour that mimics the texture of regular wheat flour without the carbs.</p>

<li>1/2 cup sugar-free chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

    <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips.</li>
