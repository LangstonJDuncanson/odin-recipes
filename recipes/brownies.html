    <p>Sure, here is a recipe for keto-friendly brownies that is sure to satisfy your sweet tooth without kicking you out of ketosis:</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 cup almond flour</li>
<li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/3 cup melted coconut oil or butter</li>
<li>3 tablespoons water</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>2/3 cup granulated erythritol or monk fruit sweetener</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1/2 cup chopped nuts (optional)</li>
<li>1/2 cup sugar-free chocolate chips (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together almond flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together melted coconut oil or butter, water, eggs, erythritol or monk fruit sweetener, and vanilla extract.</li>
<li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.</li>
<li>Fold in chopped nuts and chocolate chips, if using.</li>
<li>Pour batter into prepared pan and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs.</li>
<li>Let cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips:</h2>
<ul>
<li>For a fudgier brownie, bake for less time. For a cake-like brownie, bake for a few minutes longer.</li>
<li>You can use other nut flours in place of almond flour, such as hazelnut flour or coconut flour. Just be sure to adjust the other ingredients accordingly.</li>
<li>If you don't have erythritol or monk fruit sweetener, you can use stevia, but be careful because it is much sweeter than sugar.</li>
<li>You can also add other keto-friendly ingredients to the brownies, such as chopped dark chocolate, peanut butter, or espresso powder.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy these delicious keto-friendly brownies!</p>
